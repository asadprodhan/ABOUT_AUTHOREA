# 📚 Authorea Collaboration Guide


## **OVERVIEW**

[Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) is an **online collaborative writing platform** designed for researchers, academics, and students.  
It combines the ease of **Google Docs-style real-time editing** with the **version control of GitHub** and the **LaTeX/Markdown support of Overleaf**.  

Unlike general-purpose tools, Authorea is built specifically for scholarly writing. It provides:  
- **Integrated citation management** (search DOI, PubMed, arXiv directly in the editor).  
- **Equation and figure support** (via LaTeX and WYSIWYG).  
- **Reusable reference libraries** across projects.  
- **Data and code integration** (datasets, Jupyter notebooks).  
- **Direct publishing options** (as preprints or to partner journals).  

In short:  
- **Google Docs is great for free-form collaboration**, but it lacks citation tools and version history tuned for manuscripts.  
- **GitHub is excellent for version control**, but not all co-authors are comfortable with Git/Markdown.  
- **Overleaf is strong for LaTeX users**, but less accessible to those preferring WYSIWYG.  
- **Authorea combines the best of all three**, making it easier for teams with mixed technical backgrounds to collaborate on research writing.  


This guide explains how to use [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) for collaborative academic writing.  
It is designed to help co-authors quickly understand how to **write, edit, cite, and publish** using Authorea.
